# Bitextor output

Bitextor generates the final parallel corpora in multiple formats. These files will be placed in `permanentDir` folder and will have the following naming convention: `{lang1}-{lang2}.{prefix}.gz`, where `{prefix}` corresponds to a descriptor of the corresponding format.

## Default

The files that will be always generated (regardless of configuration) are `{lang1}-{lang2}.raw.gz` and `{lang1}-{lang2}.sent.gz`. These files come in Moses format, i.e. **tab-separated** columns.

* `{lang1}-{lang2}.raw.gz`: parallel corpus that contains every aligned sentences, has **no deduplication** and the sentences are **not filtered**.

    This file contains columns added by different optional modules: **deferred**, **Bifixer** and **Bicleaner**. In case some of these are not enabled, the corresponding columns will be omitted. The possible fields that may appear in this file are (in this order):

    1. `url1 url2 sent1 sent2 aligner_score` - default columns
        * `url1` and `url2` are source documents of the sentences
        * `sent1` and `sent2` form a sentence pair in `lang1` and `lang2`
        * `aligner_score` is the score given by the sentence aligner (bleualign or hunalign)
    2. `checksum1 checksum2` - deferred sentence checksums
        * may be used to reconstruct the original corpus using [Deferred crawling reconstructor](https://github.com/bitextor/deferred-crawling)
    3. `bifixer_hash bifixer_score` - Bifixer output
        * `bifixer_hash` tags duplicate or near-duplicate sentences
        * `bifixer_score` rates quality of duplicate or near-duplicate sentences
    4. `bicleaner_score` - Bicleaner classifer output

    This file comes accompanied by the corresponding statistics file `{lang1}-{lang2}.stats.raw`, which provides information the size of the corpus in MB and in number of  tokens.

* `{lang1}-{lang2}.sent.gz`: parallel corpus after running all of the steps described above, plus **filtering** according to the specified Bicleaner threshold, adding **ELRC** metrics, and **sorted** to have the duplicate or (near-duplicate) sentences together. This file will have all of the columns from `raw` files, plus 3 new ones corresponding to ELRC metrics.

    1. `url1 url2 sent1 sent2 aligner_score` - default columns
    2. `checksum1 checksum2` - deferred sentence checksums
    3. `bifixer_hash bifixer_score` - Bifixer output
    4. `bicleaner_score` - Bicleaner classifier output
    5. `length_ratio num_tokens_src num_tokens_trg` - ELRC fields
        * `num_tokens_src` is the number of tokens in source sentence
        * `num_tokens_trg` is the number of tokens in target sentence
        * `length_ratio` is the ratio between the two (source divided by target)

## TMX

Bitextor may also generate a [TMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_Memory_eXchange) version of the corpus, if it is enabled in config via `tmx: true`. The generated file is:

* `{lang1}-{lang2}.not-deduped.tmx.gz` will have the same content as `{lang1}-{lang2}.sent.gz`, but in **TMX** format.

## Deduplication

Bitextor may also perform the deduplication of the generated corpus (enabled via `dedup: true`), and generate the following files that will contain only unique sentence pairs:

* `{lang1}-{lang2}.deduped.tmx.gz`: **deduplicated TMX** corpus, which will contain a list of URLs for the sentence pairs that were found in multiple websites.

* `{lang1}-{lang2}.deduped.txt.gz`: **deduplicated tab-separated** corpus, with the same columns as `{lang1}-{lang2}.sent.gz`; in this case each sentence will only contain one source document

    Corresponding statistics file `{lang1}-{lang2}.stats.deduped` will be generetaed and it will have information about the size of the corpus in MB, the number of unique sentence pairs and the number of tokens on each size.

## Biroamer

If Biroamer is enabled `biroamer: true`, Bitextor will also produce a ROAMed version of the corpus, according to Biroamer [config](CONFIG.md#post-processing). Biroamer will produce either of these files, depending on `tmx` and `dedup` parameters:

* `{lang1}-{lang2}.deduped.roamed.tmx.gz`: **ROAMed** version of the **deduplicated** corpus in **TMX** format, that will be generated if `dedup` is true
* `{lang1}-{lang2}.not-deduped.roamed.tmx.gz`: **ROAMed** version of the corpus without deduplication in **TMX** format, that will be generated if `tmx` is enabled, but not `dedup`
